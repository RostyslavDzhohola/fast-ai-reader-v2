# Status Updates

## Recent Changes and Progress (as of latest update)

1. **Message Extraction Implementation**:

   - Updated `handleModalSubmit` function in `SidePanel.tsx` to send a message to the background script for Discord message extraction.
   - Implemented `processReceivedMessages` function to handle extracted messages and update chat history.

2. **Background Script Enhancements**:

   - Added a message listener in `index.ts` to handle 'extractMessages' requests.
   - Implemented `extractDiscordMessages` function to scrape messages from Discord chat.

3. **Manifest File Update**:

   - Updated `manifest.ts` to include `host_permissions` for `https://discord.com/*`, allowing access to Discord channels.

4. **Side Panel Improvements**:

   - Added modal functionality for specifying the number of messages to extract.
   - Implemented chat history persistence using Chrome's storage API.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging**:

   - Added error handling for message extraction and Chrome API interactions.

6. **Message Extraction Improvement**:

   - Modified the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to add newline characters between messages, improving readability for AI processing.

7. **Bug Fix**:

   - Corrected the return type of `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to properly return an array of strings, resolving a TypeScript error.
   - Updated `processReceivedMessages` in `SidePanel.tsx` to join the array of messages into a single string with proper separation.

8. **Message Formatting Refinement**:

   - Modified the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to add a newline character at the end of each message within the returned array.
   - Updated `processReceivedMessages` in `SidePanel.tsx` to simply join the messages without additional separation, as the separation is now inherent in each message string.

9. **Message Extraction Format Enhancement**:

   - Updated the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to format each extracted message with clear username, timestamp, and content sections.
   - Implemented visual separation between messages using separator lines.
   - This change improves readability and structure for both users and AI processing.

10. **Message Extraction Selector Refinement**:

    - Updated the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to use more precise selectors for username, timestamp, and message content.
    - Changed username selector to target `span[id^="message-username-"]`.
    - Updated timestamp selector to target the `<time>` element.
    - Modified message content selector to target `div[id^="message-content-"]`.
    - These changes should resolve the issue of zero messages being extracted and improve the accuracy of data extraction.

11. **Message Formatting Optimization**:

    - Modified the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to use a single newline character as a separator between messages.
    - Removed the repeated '=' characters used for visual separation to conserve tokens.
    - This change optimizes token usage while still maintaining clear message separation.

12. **Message Formatting Enhancement**:

    - Modified the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to enclose each message block (including username, timestamp, and content) in quotation marks.
    - Added two newline characters between each message block for clearer separation.
    - This change improves readability and structure for both AI processing and human reading, while maintaining efficient token usage.

13. **Message Formatting Visual Enhancement**:

    - Redesigned the message formatting in the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` for improved visual clarity.
    - Each message now displays the username and timestamp on one line, followed by the message content.
    - Added a visual separator (---) between messages for better readability.
    - This change enhances the user experience when viewing extracted messages while maintaining clear separation for AI processing.

14. **Debugging Enhancement**:

    - Added extensive logging to the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` and the `processReceivedMessages` function in `SidePanel.tsx`.
    - Implemented detailed console logs throughout the message extraction and processing flow.
    - This change will help in identifying and resolving issues related to message extraction and display.

15. **Error Handling Improvements**:

    - Enhanced error handling in the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts`.
    - Added more detailed logging and fallback mechanisms to prevent crashes due to null values.
    - Updated the message listener in `index.ts` to provide more detailed error information.
    - Modified `handleModalSubmit` in `SidePanel.tsx` to handle and display potential errors to the user.
    - These changes improve the robustness of the message extraction process and provide better feedback in case of failures.

16. **TypeScript Error Resolution**:

    - Updated the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to explicitly type the `messages` array as `string[]`.
    - Added type annotations to the `messageCount` parameter in the function passed to `chrome.scripting.executeScript`.
    - Added a type assertion when returning the result to ensure TypeScript recognizes it as an array of strings.
    - These changes resolve the TypeScript error related to the implicit 'any' type for the `messages` variable.

17. **Further TypeScript Error Resolution**:

    - Updated the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to explicitly type the return value of the function passed to `chrome.scripting.executeScript` as `string[]`.
    - This change resolves the remaining TypeScript error related to the implicit 'any' type for the `messages` variable in all locations.

18. **Simplification and Bug Fix**:
    - Simplified the `extractDiscordMessages` function in `index.ts` to reduce complexity and potential points of failure.
    - Removed extensive logging that may have been causing issues with script execution.
    - Updated the message listener to use a more straightforward approach for sending the response.
    - These changes aim to resolve the "Script execution returned no results" error and restore functionality to the message extraction process.

## Completed Tasks

- Message extraction functionality is now operational.
- Side panel can receive and process messages from Discord.
- AI interaction based on extracted content is now possible.
- Chat history persistence implemented.

## Next Steps

- Test the updated message extraction process with various Discord chat scenarios.
- Investigate why the message elements are not being found (possible selector issues or page structure changes).
- Consider implementing a content script that can directly interact with the Discord page DOM for more reliable message extraction.

## Known Issues

- None reported at this time.

## Upcoming Features

- Consider adding options for different AI models or response styles.
- Explore possibilities for more advanced Discord message filtering or categorization.
